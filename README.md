Advent of code 2019 using Kotlin

I don't get to code for my day job anymore and haven't found a tech hobby that's kept my attention.  I'd been programming Java since 1996 and felt the language's core issues were not getting addressed and new capabilities were being added making it feel awkward the way C++ did back in the day.

I'm trying to write <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> for the first time, and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is a nice way to give me a variety of coding challenges to learn.

Don't look at the source code if you're still trying to complete the challenges.
